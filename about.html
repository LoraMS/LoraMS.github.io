        <p>
          Hi, i'm junior front-end developer based in Sofia. I have a degree in economics and have worked as an
          accountant for several years. I decided to study programming and have been focusing on a new direction of
          training and career after attending lectures on programming basics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love the challenge of finding a way and discovering solutions. I love to solve problems with finding the
          most elegant way to write a line of code. I enjoy using my attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making
          things, to solve or a challenge to puzzle over.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love learning new things and love building sites from start to finish! I have a strong motivation and
          willingness to learn and develop in the field of front-end development. I love spending time on fixing little
          details and optimizing web apps.
        </p>
        <p>Feel free to get in touch or take a look at my work.</p>
